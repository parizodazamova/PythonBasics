# '''
# DICTIONARY (HASHMAP)
# A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is connected
# to a value, and you can use a key to access the value associated with that key.
# A keyâ€™s value can be a number, a string, a list, or even another dictionary.

# 2. given a phrase, count how many times vowels( a, e, i, o, and u) were used.
# 3. use dictionary, for loop, if condition, setdefault()
